# Business Understanding

KBO Marketing Company LLC is a marketing firm.  The firm wants to develop a model that can predict sentiment analysis for technology products such as smartphones.

The company's C-suite executives request their in-house data scientists to develop a prototype.  For the prototype, the in-house data scientists will perform the following:

- Leverage tweets for the Apple and Google brand and its respective products
- Classify sentiment analysis into two groups: *Not Positive* and *Positive*

# Data Understanding

The data for examing the aforementioned problem comes from the following source: [Brands and Product Emotions](https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions) 

Before beginning to create a model, I want to examine and become familiar with the dataset. I will conduct exploratory data analysis in order to understand the dataset attributes, which includes, but not limited to the following:

1. Number of Columns
2. Number of Rows
3. Column Names
4. Format of the data in each column
